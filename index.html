I can see the issue from your screenshot. The deployment is failing with "Timeout reached, aborting!" errors. This means the build succeeded, but the actual deployment to GitHub Pages timed out.

## Quick Fixes for Deployment Timeout

### Solution 1: Reduce File Size
The HTML file with all the JavaScript is quite large (~15.8 KB shown in artifacts). Let's create a simpler version:

**Create a minimal `index.html` to test deployment:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Cancer Research Visualizer</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Cancer Research Visualizer</h1>
    <p>Coming soon - academic paper search tool</p>
    <script>
        console.log('Basic deployment test');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Solution 2: Split the Code
Instead of one large HTML file, split it:

**index.html** (minimal):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Cancer Research Visualizer</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">Loading...</div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**styles.css** (move CSS here)
**app.js** (move JavaScript here)

### Solution 3: Retry the Deployment
Sometimes it's just a temporary GitHub issue:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Re-run failed jobs** on the failed deployment
3. Wait for it to complete

### Solution 4: Use Different Branch Strategy

1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`:
```bash
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

2. In Settings > Pages, change source to `gh-pages` branch

### Solution 5: Manual Deployment

If automated deployment keeps timing out:

1. Download the GitHub Pages artifacts (the zip file shown in your screenshot)
2. Extract and verify the contents
3. Try pushing smaller commits:

```bash
# Make smaller changes
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update HTML only"
git push

# Then add other files separately
git add styles.css
git commit -m "Add styles"
git push
```

## Most Likely Solution

The timeout is probably due to the complex JavaScript with multiple API calls. Try this minimal version first:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Cancer Research Visualizer</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 40px; }
        .search-box { padding: 10px; margin: 20px 0; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Cancer Research Visualizer</h1>
    <input type="text" class="search-box" placeholder="Search research papers...">
    <button onclick="alert('Search functionality coming soon!')">Search</button>
    <p>Full API integration will be added after basic deployment works.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Once this deploys successfully, you can gradually add the complex features back.

Try the minimal version first - this should deploy in under 30 seconds and help us confirm GitHub Pages is working for your repository.
